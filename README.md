## Project Overview
Brain tumor detection is a complex challenge, but our project tackles it head-on! We're using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify brain tumors into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, and No Tumor. The web application integrates the trained CNN model to make predictions on user-uploaded images.

## Dataset
The dataset includes 2,896 medical images across four classes:

- **Glioma Tumor**: 926 images
- **Meningioma Tumor**: 937 images
- **No Tumor**: 500 images
- **Pituitary Tumor**: 901 images

Organized as follows:


## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-detection.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Prepare the Dataset**:  
    Ensure you have the dataset in the specified directory structure (`/dataset/Training` and `/dataset/Testing`).

## Getting Started
1. **Run the Flask Application**:  
    ```bash
    python Webapp.py
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Web App**:  
    Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3. **Upload Your Image**:  
    Upload an image of a brain scan through the web interface and receive predictions and confidence levels.

## Model Architecture
Our CNN architecture includes:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Feature extraction with ReLU activation.
- **Max-pooling Layers**: For dimensionality reduction.
- **Dropout Layers**: For regularization and preventing overfitting.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: For classification.
- **Output Layer**: Uses softmax activation for multi-class classification.

## Training the Model
Training involves:

1. **Data Loading**: Load images from specified training and testing directories.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization, resizing, and data augmentation (e.g., rotation, flipping, zooming).
3. **Data Splitting**: Training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 60% training, 20% validation, 20% testing).
4. **Model Compilation**: Use categorical cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer.
5. **Model Training**: Train the model, monitoring validation loss and accuracy.
6. **Early Stopping**: Avoid overfitting by stopping training when validation loss plateaus.
7. **Model Saving**: Save trained model weights for future use and deployment.

## Evaluation & Metrics
We assess the model's performance using:

- **Accuracy**: How often the model is correct.
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-score**: For each class (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary, No Tumor) to understand performance across categories.

Consider using saliency maps, SHAP values, or other interpretability methods to explain the model's decisions.

## Deployment
Deploy the trained model as a web application using Flask. Options for deployment include local servers or cloud platforms (AWS, GCP). Consider using Docker for containerization.
